It takes a path to a directory of files, a key and a substitution text as arguments,
and replaces all matched text or pattern in the files by the substitution.

Usage: java sandr [options]
	
	options:
		
		-rk : indicating key is regex rather than literal text
		-rs : indicating substitute is regex rather than literal text
		-c  : indicating key is case sensitive
		-m  : indicating match key on word boundary rathen than in any substring
		-o  : indicating write output log file
	
	When prompted to enter:	
		
		input path: source path containing the files to be processed, absolute or relative
		
		output path: path to the file for outputting a list of which files are modified
		
		key: text or pattern to be replaced if found in files
